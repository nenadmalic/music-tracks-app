# Music tracks app

Music tracks app built with SvelteKit, SQLite, better-sqlite3, Bulma and [Chinook](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/) dataset. Based on the tutorial created by [Philipp Hartenfeller](https://youtu.be/iO4VUbQ6ua4?si=PF23N6uMB0VBU05U).

The goal of this exercise is to practice working with SvelteKit and how it connects to and loads and inserts data into SQLite. Secondary goal is to practice working with Git & GitHub.
